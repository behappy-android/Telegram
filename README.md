## What this is

BeHappy for Android is the official Android client for the BeHappy
messenger. It is built on top of the Telegram for Android codebase
under GPL v2, with the following high-level modifications:

- Networking layer rewritten to use the **MVSy 1.0** protocol and
  connect to BeHappy backend servers (instead of MTProto 2.0 / Telegram
  DCs).
- Branding, visual identity, and product naming replaced throughout.
- Telegram-specific features removed where not applicable to BeHappy
  (e.g., Telegram Premium subscriptions, Telegram Stars, Fragment
  integration, sponsored messages).
- Additional features added that are unique to BeHappy.

The complete list of changes from upstream is tracked in
[`CHANGELOG.md`](CHANGELOG.md).

## Building from source

Build instructions are inherited from upstream. The only change is
configuration:

   in the resources).
2. Bundle the BeHappy app icon and resources in place of Telegram's.
